# AW Smart Grids EA

This code is a sample Expert Advisor (EA) for the MetaTrader 5 platform, specifically designed for the AW Smart Grids trading strategy. The EA is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and can be found on their website forexroboteasy.com.

## Product Description

AW Smart Grids EA is an advanced forex trading software that implements the Smart Grids trading strategy. The EA uses a Moving Average indicator to determine the market trend and places buy or sell orders accordingly.

### Strategy Overview

The EA follows a simple yet effective strategy. It waits for the price to cross above or below a Moving Average line to identify a potential trend reversal. 

When the price crosses above the Moving Average, the EA places a buy order with a specified lot size. The take profit level is set at a certain distance from the entry price, while the stop loss level is set at a smaller distance to limit potential losses.

Conversely, when the price crosses below the Moving Average, the EA places a sell order with the same lot size, take profit, and stop loss levels.

The EA has a maximum limit of orders in the basket, which can be set by the user. If the number of existing orders is below the limit, the EA continues to monitor the market and place new orders when the conditions are met.

### Key Parameters

- `MA_Period`: Moving Average period used for trend identification.
- `LotSize`: Lot size for each trade.
- `TakeProfit`: Take profit level in points.
- `StopLoss`: Stop loss level in points.
- `MaxOrders`: Maximum number of orders in the basket.
